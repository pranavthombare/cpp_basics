# Introduction to C++

Many young students would argue that C++ is an old language and is outdated. However the truth is far beyond this. C++ is widely used in the industry and is one of the few languages which is used to interact with the computing hardware directly. 

Applications range from being used in the finance industry with low latency programming to being used in embedded engineering where we have to fingure out a way to utilise the hardware as per our requirements. 

In fact many programming languages use C/C++ under the hood to leverage its blazing fast code execution. 

In this repository, I'll try to summarise all the basic things required to get started with C++, but in a practical way. (Which I think is much better). The order matters because every chapter has a goal. 

If you ask yourself "Why am I [insert chapter name]?", you'd get the answer in the chapter.
